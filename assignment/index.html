          And on the pedestal, these words appear: <br/>
          ‘My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings; <br/>
          Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!’ <br/>
          Nothing beside remains. Round the decay <br/>
          Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare <br/>
          The lone and level sands stretch far away. <br/> <br/>

          - from Ozymandias, by Percy Bysshe Shelley

          When the snows fall and the white winds blow, the lone wolf dies, but the pack survives. Summer is the time for squabbles. In winter, we must protect one another, keep each other warm, share our strengths. <br/> <br/>
